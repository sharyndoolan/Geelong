    "bio": "Continues to grow as a player each and every year, with 2023 no exception as Close recorded several career highs last year. Amassed 24 disposals in the round 15 win over Melbourne, seven inside 50’s against North Melbourne in round 17, and four goals against West Coast in round five. Was voted best on ground against West Coast and received his first career Brownlow votes, continuing to be an asset with his forward half pressure while booting 21 goals for the season."

    "bio": "Put together another solid campaign in 2023 and was closing in on his 250 game milestone, before an injury in the round 20 clash with Fremantle cut his season short. Continues to be one the competition’s most versatile players, with Blicavs’ aerobic capacity meaning he can play right across the ground. Averaged 16 disposals and a career high four clearances per game, while also pushing forward to kick 12 goals from his 19 appearances. Spends valuable time as the back up ruckman, and will be crucial to the Cats once again in 2024."
