      It is believed that the co-founder of Australian football, Thomas
      Wentworth Wills, recommended the formation of the Geelong Football Club in
      July 1859 making it the second oldest continuously existing club at an
      elite level of any code in the world. <br />
      It is believed that rough and tough diggers on the Victorian goldfields
      played football with no formal rules in the early 1850s. They came from
      all corners of the world, including Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland,
      France, Germany, America and China. They would conjure the best rules
      available, anything they were familiar with; whatever they used it
      produced a game that was fierce and chaotic, many a tussle settled with
      strength and pluck and with 20 or more aside, flying boots, fists and
      elbows produced bone shattering results. <br /> Geelong has a proud
      history, having won ten AFL and seven VFA premierships in its history. The
      Cats tasted success in 1925, 1931, 1937, 1951, 1952, 1963, 2007, 2009,
      2011 and 2022. The club has also won flags at other levels, including the
      night cup, reserves, under 19 and VFA/VFL. <BR></BR> Below are the players
      of the 2024 squad.
