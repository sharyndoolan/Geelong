      <h2>The Geelong Football Club</h2>
      <p>
        It is believed that the co-founder of Australian football, Thomas
        Wentworth Wills, recommended the formation of the Geelong Football Club
        in July 1859 making it the second oldest continuously existing club at
        an elite level of any code in the world. <br />
        It is believed that rough and tough diggers on the Victorian goldfields
        played football with no formal rules in the early 1850s. They came from
        all corners of the world, including Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland,
        France, Germany, America and China. They would conjure the best rules
        available, anything they were familiar with; whatever they used it
        produced a game that was fierce and chaotic, many a tussle settled with
        strength and pluck and with 20 or more aside, flying boots, fists and
        elbows produced bone shattering results. <br /> Geelong has a proud
        history, having won ten AFL and seven VFA premierships in its history.
        The Cats tasted success in 1925, 1931, 1937, 1951, 1952, 1963, 2007,
        2009, 2011 and 2022. The club has also won flags at other levels,
        including the night cup, reserves, under 19 and VFA/VFL. <br /> Below
        are the players of the 2024 squad.
